Summary: Dedicated power up waveforms creates flipping-bits in SRAM memory, at low voltage (a few hundred mV). Such signals define memory fingerprints, before the processor might work. They can be used as a reliable, low cost way, to perform dynamic authentication for micro-controller unit (MCU) without cryptography means. This effect could become a major technology for cyber security, especially in the IoT context.
